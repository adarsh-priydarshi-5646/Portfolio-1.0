# Portfolio - Adarsh Priydarshi

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, hosted at [adarshpriydarshi.vercel.app](adarshpriydarshi.vercel.app).

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to create a modern and responsive portfolio:

* **TypeScript:** For type safety and improved code maintainability.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid UI development and consistent styling.
* **Vite:**  A fast build tool for development and deployment.
* **HTML & CSS:**  For the foundational structure and styling of the website.
* **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and dynamic functionality (though likely minimal given the Tailwind/TypeScript focus).


## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

* **`src`:** Contains the main source code for the application.
* **`public`:** (Likely implied, not explicitly shown)  Contains static assets such as images.
* **`package.json`:**  Project dependencies and scripts.
* **`tailwind.config.js`:** Tailwind CSS configuration.
* **`vite.config.ts`:** Vite configuration file.
* **`tsconfig.*.json`:** TypeScript configuration files.
* **`.gitignore`:** Specifies files and directories to exclude from version control.
